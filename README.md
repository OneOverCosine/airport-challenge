## Installation and Running
Fork and clone this repo to your local machine  

To run tests:  
In the project root directory, use the command `node specRunnerjs`  


## My Approach
Using the given user stories, I first made [domain models](./my-workings/domain-models.md) for each of them. I used the noun/verb approach to build up a list of possible objects and messages. Once I had a domain model for each story, I moved onto test planning.  

With [test planning](./my-workings/testing-thoughts.md) I went through each user story one-by-one, writing out my initial thoughts before comming up with suitable tests for each requirement.

# Airport Challenge

## Installation, Tests, and Running
Fork and clone this repo to your local machine  

To run tests:  
In the project root directory, use the command `node specRunnerjs`.  

Airport runner is an `index.js` file within the `src` folder.  

## My Approach
Using the given user stories, I first made [domain models](./my-workings/domain-models.md) for each of them. I used the noun/verb approach to build up a list of possible objects and messages. Once I had a domain model for each story, I moved onto test planning.  

With [test planning](./my-workings/testing-thoughts.md) I went through each user story one-by-one, writing out my initial thoughts before coming up with suitable tests for each requirement. I made sure that the tests all passed before moving onto the next user story.  

For some requirements I found that I had to go back and make changes to previous tests. I put this down to inexperience with planning tests and I'm hoping to improve that for the next challenge.
